## 🧠 AI & MBSE Architecture
### Key Design Principles
- **Separation of control and function** – LLM agent manages decision logic; UI handles presentation.  
- **Layered architecture (4+1 View Model)**  
  - Logical View → UML Class Diagram  
  - Process View → Activity Diagram  
  - Development View → Package Diagram  
  - Physical View → Deployment Diagram  
  - Use Case View → User Scenarios (Patients, Doctors, Tech Team)

### Core Agentic AI Design
- **LLM Agent Architecture** based on **BDI (Belief–Desire–Intention)** model:  
  - *Beliefs:* User data & knowledge base  
  - *Desires:* Health goals & queries  
  - *Intentions:* Executable plans (triage, advice, scheduling)
